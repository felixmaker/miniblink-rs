# miniblink-rs

Rust bindings to [mininlink49](https://github.com/weolar/miniblink49)

See [hello.rs](./miniblink/examples/hello.rs) for basic usage

# Notes

This project is now under development, which means it's not ready for production.

The api in rust safe wrapper `./miniblink` may changed in the future.

You can just use `./miniblink-sys`, which is generated using `bindgen`.

The rust safe wrapper is not aimed to provide a complete API set. If you need a specified API, create an issue or pull a request.

Thank you!
